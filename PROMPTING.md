My Use of ChatGPT in WeatherWise Project

This file explains how I used ChatGPT during the WeatherWise assignment. I didn’t just ask it to write code. I tried to guide it to help me understand and improve the project.

Prompting strategies I used:

1. I started by describing the problem in my own words. For example, I told ChatGPT “I’m trying to get the weather data from wttr.in API but I don’t know how to extract temperature”. This helped me get a more relevant and simpler explanation.
2. I asked for steps or logic first before writing full code. For example, I said “can you give me the basic logic for plotting a temperature chart?” and then I tried writing it myself before asking for full code.
3. When something didn’t work, I copied the error message and explained what I had tried. Like one time I got a KeyError for 'forecast' and I asked “why am I getting this error when I use weather_data like forecast
4. I also asked for improvements. I told ChatGPT “how can I make this more modular?” and it suggested I move the visualisation code into a function. That made my notebook cleaner.
5. I asked what to do if the user typed a wrong city name. ChatGPT helped me add try-except to catch API errors and return a friendly message instead of crashing.These are not just copy-paste prompts. I tried to learn how to ask better questions so I could also understand what was going wrong and fix it myself.I saved all my important ChatGPT chats in the ai-conversations folder. Also, I created before_after_example.md to show how some code was improved with help.
