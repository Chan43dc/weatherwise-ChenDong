SECTION 1 - PROMPT 1:
I’m creating a CLI task manager in Python for my final project.
It should let users add, list, and remove tasks.
Please write pseudocode using only basic Python techniques we’ve learned in class,
such as lists for storage, functions, input(), print(), and while loops.
Do not use any advanced features like classes or external libraries.
Use a clear and structured plan like we learned in Week 2.

AI RESPONSE:
PROBLEM:
Create a simple CLI task manager that allows users to add, view, and remove tasks.

INPUT:
- User selections from a menu
- Task descriptions
- Index number for removing tasks

OUTPUT:
- Confirmation messages
- Task list
- Error messages

PSEUDOCODE:

DEFINE tasks as empty list

FUNCTION add_task():
    ASK user for task description
    APPEND task to tasks
    DISPLAY "Task added"

FUNCTION list_tasks():
    IF tasks is empty:
        DISPLAY "No tasks"
    ELSE:
        FOR each task with index:
            DISPLAY index + 1 and task

FUNCTION remove_task():
    ASK user for task number
    CONVERT to integer and subtract 1 for index
    IF index is valid:
        REMOVE task at index
        DISPLAY "Task removed"
    ELSE:
        DISPLAY "Invalid number"

FUNCTION display_menu():
    DISPLAY menu:
        1. Add task
        2. List tasks
        3. Remove task
        4. Quit

FUNCTION main():
    WHILE True:
        CALL display_menu()
        ASK user for choice
        IF choice is 1:
            CALL add_task()
        ELIF choice is 2:
            CALL list_tasks()
        ELIF choice is 3:
            CALL remove_task()
        ELIF choice is 4:
            DISPLAY "Goodbye"
            BREAK
        ELSE:
            DISPLAY "Invalid option"

COURSE CONSTRAINT CHECK:
I used the planning method from Week 2: Computational Thinking and Planning Before Coding.
This helped me break the program into small functions before writing code.
