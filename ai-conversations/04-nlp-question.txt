User: I want user to ask questions like “what’s the temperature” and get response. How?

ChatGPT: You can create a `parse_weather_question()` function to detect keywords like "temperature", "rain", "wind" etc.

User: Should I use regular expressions?

ChatGPT: You can, but for simple checks, just use `if "temperature" in question.lower()`.

User: And then return parsed info?

ChatGPT: Yes, for example:
return {"location": "Perth", "attributes": ["temp"]}

User: Ok this is clear now. Thanks.
