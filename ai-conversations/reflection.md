This WeatherWise project was very challenging but also interesting. At first, I didn’t know how to use real weather data in Python. I never worked with APIs before, so I got stuck trying to use the OpenWeatherMap API. When I tried to fetch the data, it always failed. I didn’t understand what was wrong until I checked the API key and read some forum suggestions. I learned that I must activate my key and wait before using it.
Another difficulty was drawing weather charts. I tried to use matplotlib, but it was confusing at first. I didn’t know how to extract the temperature or humidity values from the dictionary. I asked AI tools like ChatGPT and they helped explain how to loop through the forecast data and build the x and y lists. I followed those steps and successfully created line and bar charts.
One more part I had trouble with was writing the natural language question system. I wanted the program to understand when users type something like “What’s the weather in Perth today?”. I didn’t know how to make that work, but again ChatGPT helped by showing how to look for keywords and return useful information.
During this project, I also learned how to use GitHub better. I created folders, committed files, and managed my project online. I saved five AI conversations that show how I solved problems with help.
In the end, I feel I improved my Python skills, especially in using APIs, data visualisation, and debugging. I also feel more confident to use AI tools responsibly to support my coding process.
