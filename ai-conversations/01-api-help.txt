User: Hello, I’m working on a weather project using OpenWeatherMap API in Colab. But I keep getting “Failed to fetch weather data.” Any idea what’s wrong?

ChatGPT: That usually means the API key isn’t working properly. Are you including it in the URL?

User: Yes, I think so. I used this:
url = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q=Perth&appid=MYKEY&units=metric"

ChatGPT: Okay, a couple of things to check:
1. Replace "MYKEY" with your real API key.
2. Make sure your key is active and not expired.
3. Copy and paste it into your browser. What message do you see?

User: The browser shows a 401 error.

ChatGPT: That means your key is invalid or not activated yet. Try creating a new key in your OpenWeatherMap account and wait a few minutes before using it.

User: Got it. I’ll make a new key and test again.
