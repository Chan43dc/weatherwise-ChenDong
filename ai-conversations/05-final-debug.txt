User: I run everything but `get_weather_data()` still returns error.

ChatGPT: Is it returning {"error": "Failed to fetch weather data."}?

User: Yes exactly that.

ChatGPT: Try printing the actual status code:
print(response.status_code)
print(response.text)

User: It says 401 invalid key…

ChatGPT: That confirms API key issue. While testing, you can use mock data if needed.

User: Yes I did that. Now graph and question answering works.

ChatGPT: Excellent! You’re ready to submit then.
