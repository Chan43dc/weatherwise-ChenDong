User: How can I draw a temperature chart in my weather app using python?

ChatGPT: You can use matplotlib for that. First extract datetime and temp from your weather data, then plot:

plt.plot(datetimes, temps)

User: I have a dictionary like this:

{
 "forecast": [
  {"datetime": "2025-05-21 12:00", "temp": 25}
 ]
}

ChatGPT: Great! Just loop over that to build your x and y lists:

datetimes = [d['datetime'] for d in forecast]
temps = [d['temp'] for d in forecast]

User: Ok thanks, I will try plot now.
