User: I want to draw a rain or humidity chart like bar chart. Is that possible?

ChatGPT: Yes! You can use matplotlibâ€™s `plt.bar()` to show humidity.

User: My data looks like:
[{"datetime": "2025-05-21 15:00", "humidity": 60}]

ChatGPT: Then do:
plt.bar(datetimes, humidities)

Make sure:
datetimes = [e["datetime"] for e in forecast]
humidities = [e["humidity"] for e in forecast]

User: Got it. Looks nice! Thanks.
