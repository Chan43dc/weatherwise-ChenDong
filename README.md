This is my final project for the WeatherWise assignment. It’s a small weather assistant that I built using Python, where users can check the weather, see some charts, and even ask weather questions like “Will it rain in Perth today?”.

I used Google Colab to build the notebook, and I also used ChatGPT to help me plan, debug, and improve the code step by step.


What this project can do?
Get weather data (like temperature and rain chance) for different cities
Show two charts:
   Max temperature for the next 5 days
   Rain chance for the next 5 days
 Let users type natural questions (like talking to a chatbot)
 Give back a simple natural-language answer

 How to use it?
1. Open `starter_notebook.ipynb` in Google Colab  
2. Run all cells from top to bottom  
3. At the end, type a question like “What’s the weather in Tokyo tomorrow?”  
4. Or try running the chart cells for temperature or rain



AI using in this project

I used ChatGPT during development. It helped me with:
Writing functions step by step
Debugging problems when the code didn’t work
Improving the code with better logic
Understanding how to work with JSON from the weather API

You can see all my conversations in the folder `ai-conversations/`.
